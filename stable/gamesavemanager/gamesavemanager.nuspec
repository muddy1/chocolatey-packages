    <summary>The easy way to backup, transfer and share your PC save data.</summary>
    <description>Perhaps you have been a victim of file corruption, which also victimized your game saves? Maybe you wish to transfer your game save(s) to your new machine or take it with you to a friend's?

With GameSave Manager, you can easily backup, restore, and transfer your game save(s).

No longer do you need to manually track through all of those different directories to backup/restore/transfer your game saves, making it great for those who like to share game save progress with friends/family, format frequently, paranoid about data loss, etc.</description>
